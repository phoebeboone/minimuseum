        <h3>Portrait of Giovanni de’ Medici as a Child <br>
            Artist: Bronzino (Agnolo di Cosimo di Mariano) <br>
            Date: 1545 <br>
            Medium: Oil on wood <br>
            Dimensions: 58 × 48 cm (23 × 19 in) <br>
        </h3>
        <p>This portrait uses oil paint on panel and portrays Giovanni di Cosimo de’ Medici. It was painted for his father, Cosimo I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Bronzino was the official painter of the Medici Court from 1532 and did many portraits of Duke Cosimo I and his family. Cosimo had his portrait done by Bronzino around 1545, the Portrait of Cosimo I de’ Medici. Giovanni and his mother Eleonora of Toledo were the subjects of another portrait by Bronzino from around 1545 or 1546, the Portrait of Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son.

        <p>Some art historians once identified the child as a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait appears to be a little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days.

            Date: 1540-1545 <br>

        </h3>
        <p>The work is signed OPERA DEL BRONZINO FIORENTINO. It was originally commissioned for the chapel of Eleonora of Toledo in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Her husband, Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, however, presented the picture to the French Cardinal Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, chancellor of Emperor Charles V, as a political move. At Granvelle's death (1551), the work was placed in his funerary chapel at his hometown of Besançon. Originally, there were two side panels: the left one, depicting St. John the Baptist, is now in J. Paul Getty Museum; the right one, depicting Saint Cosmas, no longer exists.

        </h3>
        <p>This portrait—among Bronzino's most arresting—was painted in the 1530s. The sitter is not known, but he must have belonged to Bronzino's close circle of literary friends in Florence, a number of whom sat for the artist. Bronzino himself composed verses in the style of the great Florentine poet Petrarch (1304–74), and the fanciful and witty details in this picture—the carved grotesque heads on the table and chair and the masklike face suggested in the folds of the youth's breeches—would have been appreciated by writers as comments on masks and identity. The book is doubtless a collection of poems.

        <p>The Virgin and Child are portrayed as a bust in the foreground, above a typical landscape with towers, castles and a fluvial inlet with a small boat. The bright sky features a series of red cherubims which give their name to the picture. Also typical of Bellini is the parapet in the lower part, although this time he did not ad the cartouche with the signature.

        <p>La velata, or La donna velata ("The woman with the veil"), is one of the most famous portraits by the ItalianRenaissance painter Raphael. The subject of the painting appears in another portrait, La Fornarina, and is traditionally identified as the fornarina(bakeress) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman mistress. One of Raphael's distinctions is his attention to the clothing of the subjects of his portraits, this one depicting opulence.

It is called a corno ducale and was a type of ducal hat, worn over a linen cap.

        <p>A Woman Peeling Apples is a genre painting showing a quiet domestic scene from the time, like most of de Hooch's works. The elaborate fireplace and fur and embroidery in the mother's clothes show a prosperous household, and the cupid between the two figures implies a happy one. Its sensitive handling of light—in particular, natural light filtered into an otherwise unlit interior space—led 19th century art historians to attribute it to Johannes Vermeer, with whose work the painting does bear strong similarities.
